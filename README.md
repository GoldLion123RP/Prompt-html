## Overview

A collection of optimized prompts that act as if written by former exam writers and senior lecturers. Instead of generic study advice, these prompts deliver:

- **Ruthless prioritization** — Identifies the ~20% of material accounting for 80% of exam marks
- **Actionable structure** — High yield → Secondary → Safe to ignore → Common traps
- **Zero filler** — No waffle, no generic advice, just what you need
