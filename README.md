# Exam Prep Priority Prompt

This repository contains a highly effective system prompt designed for use with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. It instructs the AI to act as a former exam writer to generate prioritized, high-yield study guides.

## What is this?

This is not a generic study tool. It is a specific prompt engineering technique to convert raw study materials (textbooks, lecture notes, module outlines) into a **battle-tested exam strategy**.

It forces the AI to ignore "nice-to-know" information and focus strictly on "will-be-on-the-exam" information.

## How to Use

1.  Copy the contents of `prompt.html` (or the raw text if you extract it).
2.  Open your preferred LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).
3.  Paste the prompt.
4.  Follow the instructions in the prompt (paste your module content below the line).

## Prompt Variants Included

*   **Flagship Version:** The default version for standard closed-book exams.
*   **24-Hour Cram:** For last-minute revision (focuses only on high-yield).
*   **Open Book:** Tells you what to prepare in your notes vs. memorize.
*   **Multiple Choice:** Focuses on edge cases and misconceptions.

## Disclaimer

This prompt relies on the LLM's training data. While it follows strict prioritization logic, always verify with official module handbooks or past papers if possible.
